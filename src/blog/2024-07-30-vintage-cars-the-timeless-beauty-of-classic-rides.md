### Tips for Washing and Maintaining Vintage Cars with EverWash

Maintaining a vintage car requires special care and attention to preserve its beauty and functionality. Here are some tips for washing and maintaining your classic ride with EverWash:

1. **Gentle Cleaning**: Vintage cars often have delicate paint and finishes that require gentle cleaning. Use a soft microfiber towel and a mild, pH-balanced car wash soap to avoid damaging the paint.
2. **Avoid High-Pressure Washes**: High-pressure washers can be too harsh on vintage cars, potentially causing damage to seals, trim, and paint. Instead, opt for a gentle hand wash to maintain the integrity of your vehicle’s exterior.
3. **Regular Waxing**: Waxing your vintage car regularly helps protect the paint and keep it looking shiny and new. Choose a high-quality carnauba wax and apply it with a soft applicator pad for the best results.
4. **Protect the Interior**: The interior of vintage cars can be just as delicate as the exterior. Use appropriate cleaners for leather, vinyl, and fabric, and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the materials.
5. **Undercarriage Care**: Vintage cars are more susceptible to rust and corrosion. Make sure to clean the undercarriage thoroughly and apply a rust inhibitor to protect against moisture and road salt.
6. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep up with regular maintenance such as oil changes, fluid checks, and brake inspections. Regularly inspect your car for any signs of wear or damage and address them promptly to prevent further issues.
