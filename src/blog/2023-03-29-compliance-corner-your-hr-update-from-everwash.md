*This list is not comprehensive or legal advice. Always consult a professional before implementing any new processes or practices.*

We’re now officially well into the new year, and with that we often see new federal, state and local legislation go into effect that employers need to stay ahead of, or risk consequences. I bet you fell asleep after that sentence didn’t you? 

It’s perfectly understandable that many business owners with employees – especially in multiple states – struggle with the demands of running a proper operation while the rules and regs are always changing. And it can be straight up painful to have to pay constant attention to new developments while also leading your business, especially if you don’t employ a gaggle (technical term) of HR professionals, legal counsel and consultants. 

But don’t worry — we’re here for you! Each quarter we’ll share any new regulatory changes that are top of mind for our HR operations at EverWash so you can see which might impact you, and if needed, give you a starting point for further inquiry.
