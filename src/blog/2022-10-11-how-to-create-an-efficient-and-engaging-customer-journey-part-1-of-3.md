Your customer’s journey is what makes your car wash operation brand unique and
meaningful. When you think about it, your brand is how your customers get to know your
car wash and what makes your customers loyal.

Therefore, knowledge about your members and customers is one of the critical
components of your brand. Using contextual marketing helps your employees recognize
and engage customers quickly at every touchpoint. In addition, knowing who your
customers are will increase their customer satisfaction, and trust in you, thereby
increasing revenue.

#### What are Your Customer Success KPIs?

Before leveraging market automation and customer relationship tools to help
communicate with customers and create a memorable customer experience, audit your metrics. An excellent customer journey map starts with collecting the correct customer data. KPIs, or “key performance indicators” hold the key to your customer success.

The first of a three-part series, we'll explore the different stages of a customer's car wash experience, how to make it memorable through customer journey optimization, and how to keep them coming back.

Creating a winning customer journey starts with recognizing the buyer personas and personalizing their car wash experience from the very first customer engagement. Customer-centric experiences are all about getting to know your customers’ needs and pain points and providing them with what they need quickly and easily without asking. 

As you think about your current car wash operations, here are some questions. First, when customers drive into your wash, what do you know about them based on their customer persona and demographics? Do car wash attendants have the option of greeting customers by name or asking if the wash package will be the same as their last visit or if they would like to upgrade?

As your customers enter your car wash, create a customer journey that starts first with you recognizing and identifying them, classifying them, and having an experience tailored to the customer's behavior.\

For new customers, design a step-by-step onboarding data collection template that can link to other established profiles on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, or payment portals on Apple, Google, and Amazon.

In addition to collecting the basics:

* Name
* E﻿mail
* M﻿obile
* B﻿irthday

Include collecting fun personal attributes more likely to be shared by the customer, such as their favorite sports team. Personal details can make the user experience feel special and differentiated and can strengthen customer loyalty, and loyal customers ultimately increase the customer's lifetime value.

If you haven’t yet, automate your data collection with an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to make it easier for your wash attendants to enhance customer support across all of your customer touchpoints. Autonomously collecting customer data in real-time during every visit, such as wash patterns, routines, and service preferences will facilitate seamless omnichannel marketing interactions that increase brand loyalty and even earn referrals.

#### Car Wash Customer Journey Optimization (Always)

When you pause to put yourself in the customer’s shoes, you can imagine potential customer pain points and frustrations that would cause churn. Customer feedback and customer retention data will help validate your assumptions.

On the other hand, a holistic customer experience that smoothly anticipates their needs at every customer interaction will excite people to do business with you and bolster your member conversion rate. Thoughtful customer service and personalized marketing campaigns are critical to customer success and building a great, sticky brand from the customer’s perspective. Clearly, your customer journey mapping process must continually work to keep each customer segment interested long enough to make this happen.
