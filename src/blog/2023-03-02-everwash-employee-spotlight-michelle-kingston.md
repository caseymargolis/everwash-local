#### **Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?**

Michelle - Operations Manager

#### When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience prior to joining?

August 2019, no car wash experience whatsoever, I had maybe used a car wash twice in my life in total.

#### What's your favorite thing about the car wash industry?

That it is set to grow as an industry

#### What's one thing you've learned about car washing and one thing you like to share about car washing?

Learned- Just how many carwashes there are across the country and how many people use them and use them often! Share- how lucrative joining the EverWash platform is for engaged owners!

#### What do you like most about your job?

Paying our wash partners each month - I love seeing their revenue climb month over month and year over year.

#### Where is your hometown?

Penndel (aka Langhorne - Sesame Place!)

#### When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?

I actually wanted to be an archeologist, so I settled on a History degree and added on Teaching for practical reasons.

#### Are you a dog person or a cat person (or neither)?

Everyone knows our cat Churro is the love of my life, but I do also love doggos!

#### What is your favorite sports team?

Truthfully, I couldn't care less about sports! (I know, I know)

#### Are you a morning person or a night owl?

Probably a night owl, but that's without my precious melatonin gummies

#### What do you do to turn things around when you’re having a bad day?

My husband Joe makes me food :)

#### What’s your guilty pleasure?

Eating strange food combinations - Cheddar and Caramel popcorn, Gobbler sandwiches... anything sweet and salty.

#### Do you have a hidden talent? What is it?

I'm really good at blindly selecting the most expensive option or item. Shopkeepers call it "good taste."

#### If you could choose a superpower, what would it be?

Honestly, I'd settle for not needing glasses anymore

#### What is the first thing you would do if you won the lottery?

Go debt free! Then I'd go around fulfilling wish lists for some animal shelters.

#### What is something about you (a fun fact) that not many people know?

My parents brought me home from the hospital for the first time in our antique 1958 Mack fire truck.

#### What is your favorite season? Why?

Fall and Winter - I LOVE the cold and, absolutely, positively loathe the heat,  humidity, and bugs of summer.

#### What TV show/movie/song/musician are you ashamed to admit you love?

I do love the world of Bravo/TLC - Real Housewives, Below Deck, 90 Day....

#### What is the first concert you attended?

Warped Tour!

#### Who would play you in a movie about your life?

I've been told I resemble Amanda Bynes and Jennifer Lawrence, but I don't see it - also, my life is incredibly boring, so that would end up being a terrible movie about my cat.

#### What’s your favorite TV show/movie —the one you’re always watching on repeat?

Jo Jo Rabbit

#### What book are you reading now?

The Mayfair Witches trilogy by Anne Rice

#### What trend do you hope makes a comeback?

1950's clothing

#### What’s one song you have completely memorized?

Any and all early songs from Taking Back Sunday, Story of the Year, and Rise Against

#### Have you ever met anyone famous? Who?

We almost met chef Jose Garces once

#### What is the best career lesson you’ve learned so far?

The words "that's not my job" shouldn't exist together!

#### What was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?

Network Operations Specialist with Philidor - traveling the country (with Marc!), converting and maintaining pharmacies that joined Philidor and became satellite locations for us. Beyond the travel and the physical hard work, we ended up on Episode 3 of Dirty Money on Netflix... interesting and unusual!

#### Favorite travel spot/recommendation?

I will never say no to the UK.

#### Where would you like to go on a dream vacation?

Malta!
