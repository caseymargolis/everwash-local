## Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?

Garrett Ehman, and I’m a Business Development Representative as well as a temporary Account Manager for EverWash.

## When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience prior to joining?

I started in September of 2021 and never had any car wash experience! I’ve learned a lot in my almost two years and I look forward to learning more.

## What's your favorite thing about the car wash industry?

My favorite thing about the car wash industry is the fellowship between people no matter what part of the country they live in or what type of wash they work at, run, or own. Everyone is so quick to help each other out. Whether that be offering advice, sharing their own experiences, or troubleshooting an issue, someone is always there to help!

## What's one thing you've learned about car washing, and one thing you like to share about car washing?

I've learned that car washing is more than just washing cars. It's about customer satisfaction, executing creative ways to wash more cars (my personal favorite being the haunted tunnels!), and lending a hand where it's needed. I've met so many people who genuinely love the work that they do where it doesn't need to feel like a job, but rather their life's purpose.

## What do you like most about your job?

Getting to talk to wash owners every day and hearing about challenges that we can help them solve is what makes my role feel so special and meaningful.

## Where is your hometown?

Glen Mills, PA

## When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?

When I was a kid, my biggest aspiration in life was to be an airline pilot. I loved everything about airplanes and thought they were so cool!

## Are you a dog person or a cat person (or neither)?

I love cats!

## What is your favorite sports team?

My favorite sports team is the Buffalo Bills. (Go Bills!)

## If you could choose a superpower, what would it be?

If I could have any superpower, it would be teleportation. Getting to travel anywhere in the world at any time would be so cool!

## What is your favorite season? Why?

My favorite season is the Spring. It's when we're finally coming through the other side of months of the sun setting early and cold weather and can start looking forward to the Summer!

## What’s your favorite TV show/movie —the one you’re always watching on repeat?

When in doubt, you can always catch me watching The Big Bang Theory.

## What’s one song you have completely memorized?

Anything by Blink-182 I have memorized by heart!

## Favorite travel spot/recommendation?

If you're a mountains person, the Catskill Mountains are a really nice spot to hike and be grounded in nature. It's very relaxing there especially when you’re with close family and friends. Rent a house and hit up Mohonk Mountain House.

## Where would you like to go on a dream vacation?

My dream vacation would be to go to the Maldives. The pictures I've seen are insane!
