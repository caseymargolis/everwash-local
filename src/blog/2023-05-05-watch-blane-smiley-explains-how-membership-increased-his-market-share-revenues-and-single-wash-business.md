In our latest Wash Operator Spotlight, EverWash's Max Pulcini sits down for a discussion with Blane Smiley, operator and co-owner of Island Car Wash, a small chain of IBA washes in Southern Louisiana.

Blane got into car washing as a side business, but recent success thanks to revenues generated by his EverWash membership program have led to this becoming more of a full-time venture for him and his business partner.

In this conversation, Blane shares how membership powered by EverWash helped him gain more market share in his area, while bringing in wash counts and revenues that previously felt unattainable. Island Car Wash is proof that members can and does work at IBA locations.
