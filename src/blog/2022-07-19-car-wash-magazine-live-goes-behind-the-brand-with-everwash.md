EverWash's Scott Caplan and Scott Pashley recently joined Matt DeWolf on CAR WASH Magazine Live â€” the International Car Wash Association's weekly broadcast focused on bringing the car wash community together through the power of entertainment and storytelling.

In the interview, Founder Scott Caplan and Chief Revenue Officer Scott Pashley explain the back story of how EverWash started, what the company is up to today, and where we're headed in the future.
