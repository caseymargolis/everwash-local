### Introducing the New Discover Tab

One of the standout additions to the EverWash Member app is the brand-new Discover Tab, now available in the bottom menu. This feature is your gateway to a world of perks, tutorials, and lifestyle articles about car care, automotives, pop culture, and more. Whether you're a car enthusiast or just looking to get the most out of your EverWash membership, the Discover Tab has something for everyone!

### A Fresh Look and Enhanced User Experience

We've given the EverWash Member app a complete makeover, with a new look and feel that's not only pleasing to the eye but also makes navigating the app smoother and more intuitive. Our goal is to ensure that every interaction you have with the app is as enjoyable and efficient as possible.

### Simplified Sign-Up and Membership Management

Joining EverWash or adding additional memberships has never been easier, thanks to our improved sign-up experience. Once you're a member, managing your membership will be a breeze with the enhanced Membership Tab. You can upgrade, freeze, or cancel your memberships directly from the Membership Tab, giving you full control over your car wash needs in a single screen.

### Streamlined "Start Wash" Button

We understand that every car wash location is unique, which is why we've introduced a new "Start Wash" button, complete with detailed instructions for starting wash equipment on-site. This feature is especially useful for members who need to scan vacuums or use self-serve bays separately, ensuring a smooth, holistic, and hassle-free washing experience.

### But That's Not All...

In addition to the major updates we've highlighted, we've made numerous enhancements across the board to ensure that every aspect of the EverWash Member app meets your needs and exceeds your expectations! From an improved Forgot Password page and enhanced search functionality for finding EverWash locations more easily to a revamped Settings Tab that gives you greater control over your credit balance and marketing preferences. Here's the full rundown:

* **New Forgot Password Page**: We've streamlined the process of resetting your password with a new Forgot Password page, making it quicker and easier to get back to washing without a hitch.
* **Enhanced Search Functionality**: Thanks to our improved Search Page, finding the nearest or most convenient EverWash location is now more straightforward than ever. Whether you're looking to sign up for the first time or considering switching locations, the app has you covered.
* **Revamped Settings Page:** We've overhauled the Settings Page to include a new Credits Balance section. This addition makes it easier for you to manage credits earned from referrals, gift credits from friends, or when you switch to a lower-cost plan. Plus, we've simplified how you control your marketing preferences, including opting in or out of push notifications and SMS marketing, ensuring you only receive the information you want.
* **Smoother Management of Multiple Memberships**: For those of you with memberships at different locations, we've improved how the app handles multiple memberships, making it easier to manage and switch between your plans.
* **Better Messaging for Error Codes**: Encountering error codes can be frustrating, so we've improved the messaging you receive. This means clearer explanations and guidance on what to do next, minimizing any disruption to your service.
* **A Stronger Code Base:** Under the hood, we've enhanced the app's code base, which might not be something you'll see directly but will certainly feel. These improvements mean the app is now more reliable, with smoother performance, and allows our team to roll out updates and new features more efficiently in the future.

Each of these updates has been implemented with your convenience and satisfaction in mind. We're committed to continually improving the EverWash Member app to make your car washing experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible.
