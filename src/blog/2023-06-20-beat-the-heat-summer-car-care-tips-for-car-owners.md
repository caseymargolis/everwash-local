As the summer months continue to heat up, car owners should pay special attention to their vehicles to ensure optimal performance and maintain their showroom shine. While regular visits to your local car wash using your EverWash membership is an excellent start, there are additional steps you can take off the car wash lot to protect your car from the harsh effects of the scorching sun and other summer elements. It also never hurts to make sure your air conditioning and cooling system is functioning as intended, especially in the case of extreme heat waves.

### **Shield Your Vehicle from the Sun**

Prolonged exposure to the sun's intense rays on hot days can damage your car's exterior and interior. Consider parking in shaded areas or using a car cover to protect your vehicle's paintwork. Additionally, applying a layer of wax or ceramic coating to your car's surface provides an added layer of protection against harmful UV rays.

### Test Your AC Cooling System

It also never hurts to make sure your air conditioning and cooling system is functioning as intended, especially in the case of extreme heat waves. Hot summer days can sometimes bring unbearable temperatures, and the last thing you need is a surprise ac system failure. Especially if you're planning a summer road trip, an air conditioning system checkup is well worth the investment.

### **Check and Maintain Fluid Levels**

The summer heat can cause fluids in your vehicle to evaporate more quickly, leading to potential engine damage. Regularly check and top up essential fluids such as engine oil, coolant fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer fluid. Adding an oil change to these routine practices will help keep your vehicle running smoothly and prevent overheating.

### **Inspect and Maintain Your Tires**

Hot pavement and higher temperatures can increase tire pressure, which may lead to blowouts. Check your tire pressure regularly and ensure it matches the manufacturer's recommended levels. Remember to inspect the tread depth and look for signs of wear or damage. Properly inflated and well-maintained tires to the suggested air pressure levels (outlined in your owner's manual) will provide optimal traction and help improve gas mileage. It never hurts to verify spare tire is in good condition if you get a flat.

### **Protect Your Dashboard and Upholstery**

Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause your car's interior dashboard, steering wheel, and upholstery to fade and crack over time. Apply a UV protectant to your dashboard, and consider using fabric or leather protectors to prevent damage to your upholstery. Regularly cleaning and conditioning these surfaces year-round will also help maintain their appearance and longevity.

### **Check Your Battery**

Hot weather can put a strain on your car's battery, causing it to lose its charge more quickly. Ensure your battery connections are clean and secure, and check its overall health. If your battery is several years old or shows signs of weakness, replace it to avoid unexpected breakdowns. In the case of an unforeseen breakdown, having jumper cables on hand is always a smart idea.

### **Regularly Clean Your Car**

Regularly wash your vehicle to remove these contaminants that can cause paint damage or corrosion if left unchecked.
