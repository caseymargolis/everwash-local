EverWash's use of Braze has garnered a lot of attention lately. [Canvas Flow](https://www.everwash.com/newsroom/2022-07-18-braze-launches-next-generation-canvas-flow-tool-to-help-brands-create-dynamic-cross-channel-campaigns/) is an enhancement to Canvas, Braze’s proprietary, no-code visual development tool, and includes three new features — an updated and intuitive user interface, advanced real-time orchestration and personalization features, and enhanced experimentation and versioning capabilities.

"Armed with better tools and data, we were able to engage with users in more meaningful ways to help increase the lifecycle and value of our subscriptions," said Max Pulcini, Director of Marketing and Communications at [EverWash](https://www.everwash.com/). "Our membership lifespan is up by an average of one month, our monthly recurring revenue is up 30.3 percent, and 30-member retention is up 7 percent."
