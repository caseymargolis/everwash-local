In April, EverWash was ranked #45 among the fastest-growing consumer-facing marketplace startups and private companies on the a16z Marketplace 100. This was EverWash' third consecutive year on the list.

“It’s an honor to be recognized once again among the top marketplaces in the country,” said Scott Caplan, EverWash Co-Founder and CEO. “Our growing network of car washes is the largest in the nation, and it’s our mission to help more consumers discover new ways to save at their neighborhood washes and keep up with essential car maintenance.”

In August, EverWash was named to the esteemed Inc. 5000 list for the first time. A list of the top 5000 fastest-growing private companies was published in this year's rankings. Overall, EverWash was ranked #932, #24 in Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, and #88 in consumer products.

"From our early days as car wash newcomers, we have grown a lot," Caplan said regarding the ranking. "Getting into the Inc. 5000 and cracking the Top 1000 shows that disruption can have a tremendous impact on an industry. It also speaks to the dedication and hard work of our entire team — our small team achieving such a prestigious award is an amazing achievement."
