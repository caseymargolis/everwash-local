# Do's of Car Wash Pricing 

## Price Appropriate to What You're Offering

Customers are savvy enough to discern the quality of the service they're receiving. If you use premium chemicals and offer deluxe services, your pricing should reflect that. The key here is to provide value for money. Your prices shouldn't just be arbitrary figures; they should be reflective of the costs involved and the quality offered.

## Upgrade-Friendly Tiered Pricing

One effective strategy for raising the average ticket size is tiered pricing. For example, you might price your basic wash package at $12, your mid-tier at $14, and your top-tier package at $16. With a nominal price difference between the tiers, customers are more likely to opt for an upgrade, recognizing the better value for just a few extra dollars.

## Membership Multiplier

When it comes to membership pricing, a good rule of thumb is to set the price at 1.5 to 2 times the cost of a single wash. This pricing multiplier makes it easier to sell memberships by offering better value over single washes. Members save money with unlimited washes and enjoy the convenience of frequent visits without the hassle of repeated payments.

## First-Month Promotions

To incentivize new customers to opt for a membership, offer a promotion for the first month. Popular options include 50% off the first month or a special rate like $9.99. This initial offer makes it more appealing for customers to give your membership plan a try, while also providing a gateway to long-term customer relationships.

# Don'ts of Car Wash Pricing 

## Don't Price Based on Competitors 

It can be tempting to look at what your competitors are charging and adjust your prices accordingly. Every car wash is unique. If you offer superior cleaning products and services, don't compromise your pricing to match a competitor who might be offering a more basic service. Use your unique selling points to your advantage.

## Don't Undercut Your Basic Plan

A basic plan that's priced too low can make it difficult to upsell customers to more profitable packages. While you don't want to scare away potential customers with sky-high starting prices, don't sell yourself short either. A low starting price can devalue your service in the eyes of customers and hinder your ability to generate higher revenue from upgraded packages.

## Guarding Your Membership Program 

Lastly, while promotions and loyalty programs are excellent marketing tools, be careful not to cannibalize your membership program by offering an array of competing loyalty programs, special nights, or coupons. After all, it's hard to sell your female customers on membership when you offer a $5 Lady's Night each week. The aim is to strike a balance that keeps your membership program attractive while also providing occasional perks to single-wash customers.

A well-structured pricing strategy is pivotal for a thriving car wash business. By following these do's and don'ts, you not only set your car wash up for profitability but also build a loyal customer base that finds value in both single washes and memberships.
