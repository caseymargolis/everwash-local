*The car wash industry has been abuzz with discussions surrounding the pending legislation [proposing changes to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Negative Option Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/federal-trade-commission-proposes-rule-provision-making-it-easier-consumers-click-cancel-recurring). These proposed amendments aim to enhance consumer protection by making it easier for subscription and membership holders to cancel recurring charges.* 

*As a car wash operator, it is crucial to understand these proposed changes and their potential implications for your business and bottom line. That's why EverWash is putting together a series of blog posts to help you understand the proposed regulations, as well as the pros and cons of the legislation if it were to pass. This is **Part Two** of that series.*

In this article, we will summarize the key proposals, explore the reasons behind the changes, and discuss how you can navigate these potential shifts to ensure the success of your membership programs.

While the proposed changes may initially raise concerns among car wash operators, it is essential to understand their potential implications and adapt your membership programs accordingly. 

Here are some key considerations:

### **Improved Customer Experience**

By providing clear information about recurring charges and cancellation procedures upfront, the proposed changes can contribute to a more positive customer experience. Transparent communication can build trust and loyalty among your membership program participants.

### **Reduced Churn**

Although the ease of cancellation may lead to an increase in cancellations initially, it can also help you identify areas for improvement and refine your services to retain customers better. By focusing on delivering exceptional value and convenience, you can mitigate the potential impact of increased cancellations.

### **Decrease Negative Calls and Reviews**

The proposed amendments encourage businesses to streamline their cancellation processes and ensure they align with customers' enrollment methods. Embracing click-to-cancel functionality can simplify the process for both parties, reducing frustration, bad reviews, angry calls and other potential customer complaints.

### **Compliance and Reputation**

Staying informed about evolving regulations and adapting your practices accordingly is crucial to ensure compliance and protect your business's reputation. By actively implementing the proposed changes, you demonstrate your commitment to ethical operations and reinforce customer trust.

The proposed changes to the FTC's Negative Option Rule reflect a broader movement towards enhanced consumer protection and transparency. While these changes may initially pose challenges for car wash operators, they also present opportunities for refining membership programs and improving customer experiences. By adapting your practices to align with the proposed amendments, you can build stronger customer relationships, reduce churn, and solidify your position in the evolving car wash industry.

EverWash is committed to keeping you informed about industry trends, regulatory developments, and best practices. Together, we can navigate these changes and build successful membership programs that thrive in a consumer-centric marketplace.
