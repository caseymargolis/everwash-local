[The Tomahawk](https://www.thetomahawk.com/), a local news outlet serving communities in Tennessee, recently did a write up on EverWash Wash Partner Allen Yates. The article highlights the ways Allen, a [prominent area realtor](https://www.instagram.com/allenyatesrealty/?hl=en), breathed new life into the wash after "an extensive facelift."

Renovations spearheaded by Yates included a variety of technical and cosmetic changes to the washes two automatic bays, four self serve bays, and six vacuums. Other updates include wifi, app capabilities, and a new monthly membership program, powered by EverWash.

According to Yates his community is “going crazy” about EverWash. During the winter, he reports seeing around 200 cars going through the automatic wash daily. Mountain City Suds is the only EverWash-powered car wash within 80 miles, and people from outside the area report coming specifically to this carwash because of the membership program.

“Customer service is the most important thing,” Yates told the Tomahawk. “People are very patient, and I’m so honored.”
