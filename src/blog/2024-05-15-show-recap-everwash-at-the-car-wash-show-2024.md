The Car Wash Show 2024 at Music City Center in Nashville has just wrapped up, and EverWash's presence was felt strongly throughout the bustling event. This year, we had the pleasure of meeting with countless car wash operators, distributors, and industry professionals, enhancing our connections and showcasing our commitment to the car wash community.

### Connecting and Networking

Throughout the three-day trade show, the EverWash booth was a hub of activity. We engaged with new faces, reconnected with current partners, and exchanged valuable insights with other exhibitors. Traffic and enthusiasm on the show floor was high as we discussed how EverWash can [help operators excel at membership](https://www.everwash.com/wash-owners).

### Acquisition of Coinless

A significant highlight of the show was our announcement on May 13th about the [acquisition of Coinless](https://www.everwash.com/newsroom/mon-may-13-2024-09-30-51-gmt-0500-central-daylight-time-everwash-announces-acquisition-of-coinless-expanding-its-technology-and-service-capabilities-in-the-car-wash-industry/), a provider of mobile payment solutions in the car wash industry. This strategic move not only expands our technological capabilities but also broadens our remote start and hardware capabilities.

"Integrating Coinless’s hardware and technology with EverWash's capabilities allows us to offer a seamless membership onboarding and operational experience for all types of car washes," said Scott Caplan, co-founder and CEO of EverWash. "This move strategically positions EverWash to support our partners better and expand our market reach, ensuring that every car wash can Excel at Membership."

### Upcoming Educational Opportunities

In addition to networking and strategic announcements, we promoted our upcoming webinar scheduled for May 22, 2024.

### **A Musical Touch with Dylan Bradley**

Adding a touch of Nashville's famous musical charm, our booth featured a live performance from Dylan Bradley, the Keystone Kid, on the second day of the show. His blend of covers and original music provided a perfect backdrop to the day's activities, creating a memorable atmosphere for attendees and exhibitors alike.
