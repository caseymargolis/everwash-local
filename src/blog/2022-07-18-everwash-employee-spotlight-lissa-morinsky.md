*EverWash is made of hard-working people — just like you and the folks who work at your car wash! Here's this month's EverWash Employee Spotlight:*

## Lissa Morinsky, Project Manager

### Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?

My name is Lissa Morinsky, and I am the Project Manager at EverWash.

### When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience prior to joining?

I started with EverWash in May 2021. Before joining EverWash, I had absolutely no experience in the car wash industry. In fact, I hadn’t even owned a car in over a decade!

### What's one thing you've learned about car washing, and one thing you like to share about car washing?

I've really come to learn how important car washing is to increase the longevity of your car. Keeping it clean keeps the car's value high and makes you feel happy in general!

### What do you do to turn things around when you’re having a bad day?

I play my happy song! I don’t know why but the song "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers cheers me up every time. 

### Are you a coffee or tea person?

Coffee… definitely coffee. You really don’t want to see me without it. That being said, my favorite drink is apple juice.

### What’s the weirdest food you’ve ever eaten?

Chocolate-covered bugs. Thankfully, I only got a crunch and none of the bug flavor…or legs!

### What TV show/movie/song/musician are you ashamed to admit you love?

I am not proud, but yes, I am a Fanilow! Barry Manilow is a joy! I have the words of "Copa Cabana" completely memorized because the distance from my apartment to the nearest tram stop was exactly the length of that song.

### What's your favorite travel spot or recommendation?

My favorite city is Prague, but I am biased because I actually lived there for a long time. My favorite small town is Bellagio, Italy, because it's so peaceful and idyllic. Lastly, my favorite beach is Om Beach in Gokarna, India. This is the most beautiful, unspoiled beach I've ever been to in my life.
