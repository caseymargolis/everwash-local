*EverWash is made of hard-working people — just like you and the folks who work at your car wash! Here's this month's EverWash Employee Spotlight:*

## Max Pulcini, Director of Marketing & Communications

#### Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?

My name is Max Pulcini and I'm the Director of Marketing & Communications at EverWash.

#### When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience prior to joining?

Yes! My first paying job was as a car wash attendant at Auto Shine Car Wash in Berlin, NJ. I worked there for one summer, and came back to work as a cashier the following summer.

#### What's one thing you've learned about car washing and one thing you like to share about car washing?

Wash together, win together! There's plenty of room for teamwork and collaboration in this industry and plenty of business to go around.

#### When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?

I wanted to be a Formula 1 race car driver! But karting is expensive and dangerous, so [I settled on Mario Kart 64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_ofGEYvEJ0) at a young age to satisfy my need for speed.

#### What do you do to turn things around when you’re having a bad day?

Throw on Halo and a good podcast, or watch reaction videos to the "Portals Scene" from "Avengers: Endgame".

#### What is your favorite season? Why?

Fall... Best temperatures, plus the start of football and basketball season. Tee Shirt and Hoodie + Jeans = best outfit combo

#### What’s your favorite TV show/movie —the one you’re always watching on repeat?

The Big Lebowski — one of the funniest, most quotable movies out there. "Donny, you're out of your element!"
