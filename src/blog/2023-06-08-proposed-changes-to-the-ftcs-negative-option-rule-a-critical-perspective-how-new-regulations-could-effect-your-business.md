*The car wash industry has been abuzz with discussions surrounding the pending legislation proposing changes to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Negative Option Rule. These proposed amendments aim to enhance consumer protection by making it easier for subscription and membership holders to cancel recurring charges.*Â 

*As a car wash operator, it is crucial to understand these proposed changes and their potential implications for your business and bottom line. That's why EverWash is putting together a series of blog posts to help you understand the proposed regulations, as well as the pros and cons of the legislation if it were to pass. This is **Part Three** of that series.* 

While the proposed changes to the Negative Option Rule aim to protect consumers and address common complaints, there are concerns about potential unintended consequences caused by the amendments. Here are some of the concerns regarding how these proposed changes could potentially hurt businesses:

### Increased Cancellations

One of the primary concerns is that the proposed changes might make it easier for consumers to cancel their subscriptions. While this enhances consumer rights and control, it can result in a higher churn rate for businesses. Increased cancellations can lead to a loss of recurring revenue, impacting the stability and financial health of the business.

### Higher Administrative Costs

Implementing the proposed changes may require businesses to invest in system upgrades and operational adjustments to comply with the new requirements. For example, providing clear information upfront, obtaining express informed consent, and enabling click-to-cancel functionality might necessitate changes to existing billing systems and customer interfaces.

### Regulatory Compliance Challenges

Adapting to the proposed changes might pose challenges for businesses in terms of understanding and implementing the new requirements correctly. Compliance with the revised regulations can be complex, especially for small businesses lacking the necessary resources or expertise. Failure to comply with the updated rules could expose businesses to legal risks and potential penalties.

### Dissenting Voices

In her dissenting statement to the proposed amendments, FTC Commissioner Christine S. Wilson expressed concerns about the changes to the Negative Option Rule. She argued that the rule, as it currently stands, already provides sufficient consumer protection without the need for significant amendments. 

Specifically, Commissioner Wilson raises concerns about the potential increase in administrative burdens for businesses, the likelihood of higher costs and reduced innovation, and the potential for abusive practices by unscrupulous businesses. She argued that these changes might harm legitimate businesses that operate in good faith while not necessarily addressing the core issues that the rule intends to tackle.

Commissioner Wilson suggested that instead of making substantial changes, the focus should be on enforcing the existing rule more effectively and efficiently. She emphasized the importance of targeted enforcement actions against businesses engaged in deceptive practices, along with educational efforts to empower consumers to make informed choices.

### What's Next?

According to the [FTC's website](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/24/2023-07035/negative-option-rule), comments close on the proposal on June 23, 2023. In the meantime, we'll continue to provide updates on the matter. EverWash is committed to keeping you informed about industry trends, regulatory developments, and best practices.

It is important to note that these potential negative consequences can vary based on the specific circumstances and the actions taken by individual businesses.
