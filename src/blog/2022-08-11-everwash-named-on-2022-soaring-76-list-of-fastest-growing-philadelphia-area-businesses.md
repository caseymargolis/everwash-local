Each year, the Philadelphia Business Journal honors the region’s fastest-growing companies on the Soaring 76 — an ever-changing list that provides insight into the sectors and businesses that are taking off locally. We are proud to announce that EverWash has been named to the 2022 Soaring 76 list!

To qualify for the Soaring 76 list, companies had to meet the following criteria:

* Be independently owned
* Have sustained revenue growth from 2019 to 2021, with revenue in each year greater than in the year prior
* Have revenue of at least $750,000 in 2020 and at least $2 million in 2021
* Be headquartered in one of the following counties: Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, or Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, Ocean, or Salem in New Jersey; Kent or New Castle in Delaware

The final rankings, including the region's fastest-growing company, will be revealed on September 23, 2022.
