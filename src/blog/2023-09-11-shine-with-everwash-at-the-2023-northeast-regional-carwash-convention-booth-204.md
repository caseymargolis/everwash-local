Mark your calendars, car wash operators! The Northeast Regional Carwash Convention (NRCC) is just around the corner, taking place from October 2-4, 2023, at the Atlantic City Convention Center. This year, weâ€™re pulling out all the stops to bring you a not-to-be-missed experience. Here's everything you need to know about EverWashâ€™s presence at this year's event.

## EverWash at NRCC: The Home Advantage

Based out of Philadelphia, the NRCC is something of a "backyard show" for us. We take immense pride in showcasing our innovations in a setting thatâ€™s so close to home. EverWash will be set up at Booth #204, conveniently located across the aisle from Sonny's Booth. Trust us: You'll want to make it a point to swing by!

No matter what you are looking for, EverWash has a solution for you â€” whether it's starting your own membership program or improving an existing one, understanding customer behavior and your wash operation better, or just making sure you provide customer service that increases LTV while decreasing headaches.Â

## Introducing EverWash Assist: Your Secret to Retaining Members

In the world of car washes, rampant membership cancellations is a cause for concern. Why is that? Unanswered calls are a key factor. Research shows that 76% of car wash operators fail to answer customer calls. This frustrates customers, and results in high membership cancellation rates.

We launched EverWash Assist at The Car Wash Show '23, and the response has been nothing short of phenomenal. This innovative tool helps you reduce membership cancellations by offering unparalleled customer support services.Â
