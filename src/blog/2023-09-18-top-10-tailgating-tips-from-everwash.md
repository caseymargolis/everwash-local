Fall is a season full of excitement for sports enthusiasts. Whether you're gearing up for college football, pro football, or playoff baseball, there's nothing like the electric atmosphere of a tailgate party to get you pumped for the main event.Â 

At EverWash, we don't just help you keep your car clean; we're also here to help you make the most of your tailgating experience. With [nearly 1,000 locations nationwide](https://www.everwash.com/members), you can get your car sparkling before heading to the game. Without further ado, let's dive into our top 10 tailgating tips!

## 1. Plan Ahead

Before you head out, make a checklist of all the essentials you'll need, from food and beverages to seating and entertainment. Planning ahead ensures that you won't forget important items and sets the stage for a smooth tailgating experience.

## 2. Arrive Early

Secure the best spot by arriving at least 3-4 hours before the game starts. Early birds not only get prime parking, but they also have ample time to set up and savor the pre-game festivities.

## 3. Keep It Clean

Nobody likes a messy tailgate. Make sure you have plenty of trash bags and recycling bins. Better yet, swing by an [EverWash location](https://www.everwash.com/members) on your way to the stadium to get your car looking its best for the big day. Your clean car will be the envy of the tailgate!

## 4. Food & Beverage Station

Set up a designated area for food and drinks to keep things organized. Use insulated coolers to keep perishables fresh and beverages cold. Don't forget a portable grill for the quintessential tailgating experience.

## 5. Smart Snacking

Prep snacks that are easy to eat and won't make a mess. Think finger foods like sliders, chicken wings, and chips and dip. This way, you can keep your car interior clean while enjoying delicious fare.

## 6. The Right Playlist

Music is the heartbeat of any good party. Create a playlist of pump-up jams and classics that will get everyone in the mood for the game. A portable Bluetooth speaker is a must for this.

## 7. Tailgate Games

Cornhole, ladder toss, or a simple football toss can keep the energy up before the game starts. Just be sure to have enough space to play safely.

## 8. Comfort is Key

Pack portable chairs, blankets, and cushions to ensure everyone is comfortable. If it's a sunny day, don't forget sunscreen and hats.

## 9. Stay Hydrated

Amid all the excitement, it's easy to forget to drink water. Keep a separate cooler stocked with water bottles to stay hydrated throughout the day.

## 10. Post-Game Cleanup

Once the game is over and your team has (hopefully) secured a win, it's time to clean up. Remember, a clean tailgate is a successful tailgate. As a bonus tip, why not celebrate the win with another trip to EverWash to get your car ready for the next big game?
