"*Being a successful woman in my job day to day means I am doing my part to cause meaningful change in my industry. It's also about recognizing the strong women who help support me on my journey. From my mom, who gives me encouragement and listens to me after a long stressful day at work, to my manager, who allows me to express my feelings, frustrations, and ideas freely, and lastly, being able to see women of color in a higher up position, like [Harriet Ayoade](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAGnH80BPTk65ieiLZimIBr4Vu4lJhuOjyc) at my company, reminds me I am part of something bigger. There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish."*- Talia Scarborough.
