The New Year is a time for resolutions and getting things done. It's also the perfect time to make some changes to your car, which will keep it looking sharp and running smoothly. 

## Don't Text and Drive!

Texting while driving is dangerous and not worth the risk. In fact, in many states, texting while driving is illegal. Distracted driving can take your eyes off the road for five seconds or more. At 55 mph, that would be enough time to travel the length of a football field. That's a long distance to drive without your eyes on the road!

Even if you're just checking a reply, taking the time to look at your phone could lead to an accident or injury — which may lead to you never being able to message back. Use your phone or car's hands-free options if you must communicate using your phone while driving.

***Please DON'T TEXT AND DRIVE!***

## Check and Change Your Oil

Maintaining a smooth-running car requires regular oil changes. Older vehicles require an oil change every 3,000 miles, but with modern lubricants, most engines today have recommended oil change intervals of 5,000 to 7,500 miles. Plus, if your car's engine requires full-synthetic motor oil, it might go as far as 15,000 miles between services.

## Learn How to Change a Tire

It is critical to know what to do if your car gets a flat tire. Be sure to learn how to change a tire, and have a plan that contains everything you need, including:

* Spare tire: A tire pump is not enough for a car. The spare tire in the back of most cars serves as a temporary replacement.
* Jack: The jack needs to be strong enough to lift up and support your vehicle as you remove the damaged wheel.
* Lug Wrench: Using a lug wrench, you can loosen the nuts on the wheels so they can be removed easily from their axle slots.

## Learn How to Jump-Start a Vehicle

Jump-starting your vehicle can be extremely frustrating, especially if you've never done it. To help you learn how to jump-start a car, here's a handy YouTube Video you can save to your favorites

## Get Rid of Excess Weight in Your Car

Cars don't need to go to the gym to lose weight. Clean out your vehicle by getting rid of anything that isn't necessary, and help improve your fuel efficiency. Here's a checklist:

1. Remove all unnecessary items from your car. Do you really need three jackets, five baseball hats, two blankets, a cooler, and a bag of soccer balls taking up space?
2. Organize your car's important papers and dispose of the ones you don't need. Discard old receipts, coupons, and other miscellaneous papers. Seperate the important documents, such as your registration, insurance, and owner’s manual, and put them in a safe spot, like your glove box.
3. Keep a small trash can in your car, plug the “black hole” between your seats and make for easy clean up in your cup holders.

## Check Your Fluids Regularly

Check your fluids every month. These simple checks can tell you a lot about how well your car is running. If you notice any leaks, fix them immediately before they cause more damage or replacement parts become necessary.

* Oil
* Coolant
* Transmission Fluid
* Power Steering Fluid

## Use Your Turn Signals

This one is quick and simple: It's important to use your turn signals when turning and changing lanes. This helps other drivers know what you're doing and prevents accidents. Be courteous and use your turn signals —it's not hard to do!

## Be a More Courteous Driver

On that note: Try to be a more courteous driver in general. Be aware of other drivers. Avoid tailgating, cutting people off, and driving too fast. If someone else's driving habits make you angry, don't make sudden lane changes or honk your horn. As well as reducing accidents, safer driving also reduces stress for you and those around you.

## Wash Your Car Regularly!

A clean car is a happy car. Washing your car regularly will not only keep it looking its best but also protect the paint job from environmental damage. Use your EverWash membership to wash whenever you need or want!
