cott Pashley, EverWash’s Chief Revenue Officer, recently sat down with David Begin of the [International Carwash Association](https://www.carwash.org/) to discuss EverWash’s origins in the fitness industry, and the financial benefits of membership and recurring revenue. They also covered the company’s new emphasis on big data and how to leverage that data without leaving customers feeling uneasy.

“Four years ago, membership was beginning to be ***something*** in the car wash industry,” Pashley tells Begin. “But we saw it in a place where it was going to be ***the thing***, and maybe the biggest growth in the car wash industry was going to come from that avenue. And we had membership expertise, we just had to learn what the heck car washing was all about.”
