It’s hard to know when it’s time to hire more employees. You may be working hard for your business, but with all of the demands on your time and energy, it’s easy to think adding another full-time employee is just one more thing you don’t have time for.

But at some point, you’ll have to hire people to keep up with the demand of your car wash and avoid burnout of current staff — including you. So how do you determine when to grow your team and whether current pain points are not a training issue or an outlier in increased demand that will soon taper off?

Here are three things to look out for:

**Low customer satisfaction**

Requests are beginning to slip through the cracks, and customers are unhappy. Complaints are up, and it’s just not phone calls and emails from unsatisfied customers. Additionally, a Google search of your car wash yields negative reviews. Dealing with this could deter prospective customers from trying your car wash, resulting in a decreased market share for your wash.

**Feel drained at the end of most days.** 

You’re feeling overwhelmed with the amount of work on your plate. You’ve been working long hours, but it doesn’t feel like enough. You can’t remember the last time you took a vacation, and it’s starting to take a toll on relationships and productivity. Family and friends can’t remember the last time they spent quality time with you. Even more alarming, the demand for running your car wash is wearing you down, and your mental and physical health are both causes for concern.

**Business innovation is lacking**.

As an entrepreneur, you’re always looking for ways to grow your business, but it can be tough to find the time to implement new ideas and strategies. And when you do have the time, your current employees are usually too busy doing the day-to-day to help you grow.

On the flip side, your current employees are overworked and stressed. They, too, don’t have the space or time to develop new ideas that would help grow your car wash. You know you need a fresh perspective on things—but it’s just not happening under the current conditions.

**Choosing the right course of action.**

Because every car wash has different needs and obstacles, it can be challenging to determine the best time to grow. However, if you keep the above points in mind, you’ll be able to spot signs that a new hire is needed to keep the business moving forward.

Recently, EverWash launched a new program called Ignite. The service is currently available in a few markets, with plans to expand nationally over the next year. As part of Ignite, EverWash offers advanced training and a revenue playbook to help your car wash sell memberships and increase recurring revenue. In addition, we recruit, hire, deploy, and manage onsite sales associates to sell memberships at your wash for four to six weeks. Our Onsite Sales Associates also train your employees on best sales practices.

**Final thoughts:** If growth has been too fast or too slow, you have been feeling overwhelmed, or your employees have struggled, consider adding temporary expertise or hiring a permanent employee. Taking this course of action could improve the sustainability of your business and, most importantly, your peace of mind.
