We are delighted to introduce our Team Member Spotlight. Ryan is an outstanding team member who has made invaluable contributions since joining EverWash in 2019, and it brings us immense joy to feature him in this spotlight.

Get to know Ryan!

## Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?

My name is Ryan Caldwell and I am the B2B Marketing Manager at EverWash.

## When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience before joining?

I started working at EverWash in 2019, and was previously a graphic designer at TSS/NCS creating car wash signage.

## What's a typical day like for you at work? Any interesting rituals or routines you follow to kick-start your day?

Everyday is different with new excitement and challenges!  I always start the day with 2 glasses of water, a large cup of coffee, and 5 minutes of meditation to plan out my day.

## What's your favorite thing about working at EverWash? Is there a specific memory or achievement that stands out for you?

Without question, my favorite thing is being on a team that collaborates seamlessly while inspiring each other to crush our goals. It's the best!

## What is the best career lesson you’ve learned so far?

Stay humble and embrace continuous learning.  Industries constantly evolve, and the willingness to learn new things and adjust is crucial.

## When you're not at work, what are your favorite hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing?

Above all things, I love spending time with my kids...and that generally brings us to amusement parks. Earlier this year, my oldest daughter talked me into going on all of the rollercoasters at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio.

## Family is important to all of us. Can you please introduce us to your family through a photo or a short story about a memorable moment you've shared together?

My wife, Lisa, and I celebrated our 14-year anniversary this month. We have two daughters, Sevia (10) and Willa (8).  Earlier this year, we embarked on a road trip from Michigan to Florida that was 20 hours each way, but it was totally worth it to experience the change of scenery along the way.

## We all have our quirks. What's a fun or unique fact about you that most people at the office might not know? Any hidden talents? Are there photos?

One fun fact is that I like to sketch original comic book covers in my free time.  I generally donate them to charity auctions or to comic book enthusiasts who collect original artwork.

## Teamwork makes the dream work. Could you share a story about a memorable collaboration or a time when your team came together to overcome a challenge?

We recently rebranded EverWash, and that was 100% a team effort.  Through rounds and rounds of constructive criticism and voting, we collectively refreshed a brand that we are very proud of, and it was a delight from start to finish.

## Learning and growth are essential aspects of any career. Is there a skill you've picked up while working here that you're particularly proud of?

Well, I started off at EverWash as a graphic designer and grew into a marketing role. There is a lot of crossover, but I have certainly acquired a valuable perspective on the strategic elements that play a large role in the comprehensive evolution of a project.

## Let's talk about books, movies, or music. What's a recommendation you'd like to share with your colleagues? How does it resonate with you?

I love Marvel & Star Wars movies, but that's too easy.  I also love listening to instrumental music, and doesn't matter which genre.  I feel like it can let your soul breathe in a way that's unique to the other arts.

## We all have goals and aspirations. What's one thing on your bucket list that you're excited about and would like to achieve in the future?

I've always wanted to visit Italy. Preferably for a couple weeks, taking in all of the scenic landscapes, food, wine, museums, beaches, and the list goes on.  I'll make it there one day!
