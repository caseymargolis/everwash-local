A car’s reliability is one of the most critical factors when choosing a brand and model. After all, no one wants to find themselves stranded on the side of the road when something breaks down. Even worse? The thought of paying for repairs to an older car, especially if you have a limited budget.

That’s why we turned to [J.D. Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-us-vehicle-dependability-study), [US News](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/most-reliable-cars-cars-that-last-forever), and [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-a7824554938/) to determine which models stood out among their peers in terms of dependability and longevity. Here’s a look at some of our top picks:

## SUBARU

[Subaru](https://www.subaru.com/index.html) is a Japanese automaker known for its all-wheel drive, boxer engines, and safety features. The brand carries a strong reputation as one of the most reliable brands on the market, thanks to its main manufacturing plant being located in Japan. Japan has strict regulations when it comes to quality control.

Unlike a standard V-shaped engine, [Subaru’s signature boxer engines](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/buying-maintenance/a10295717/how-boxer-engine-works/) are positioned horizontally and reciprocate the horizontal pistons. This lower center of gravity provides better balance, stability, and control. The design also helps create a smoother acceleration and less vibration, which contributes to the durability of their vehicles.

Subaru’s most popular vehicle is the [Forester](https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/forester), which comes standard with full-time all-wheel drive, [EyeSight collision avoidance system](https://www.subaru.com/eyesight.html) with adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assistance, and switchable low-range gearing on specific models.

## TOYOTA

[Toyota](https://www.toyota.com/?srchid=SEM:700000001483645:GOOGLE:71700000016637022:58700006904073810:p62023568946:504990472772&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1267066&gclid=CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYx-xwBSeAGVHW95HKGJmz6rnPHGEdhybCe0BJ7JNkLrgCWaE5kIbb3hoCB28QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) is the world’s largest automaker and one of the oldest car brands. Toyota has been around since 1933 and is headquartered in Japan. The company was initially focused on developing small trucks that were affordable but still durable enough to handle tough jobs. The introduction of their first passenger vehicle, the [Toyopet Crown Deluxe](https://jamesbond.fandom.com/wiki/Toyopet_Crown_Deluxe), in 1957 demonstrated that they could compete with other Japanese automakers at all levels of production.

Toyota has a reputation among consumers as an automaker known for reliability over time, and there’s no denying that this reputation is well-earned when scanning over any Consumer Report.

Toyota currently offers dozens of different models across various segments, including compacts like the [Corolla](https://www.toyota.com/corolla/?srchid=SEM:700000001483645:GOOGLE:71700000083847465:58700007085048171:p63757482274:530802814933&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYx0a4sMnYeUhgZK_0y4epSNXLvaZ7cG3oQsYZPDx01m9g2xiEhY0fUhoCv4UQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), sedans like the [Camry](https://www.toyota.com/camry/?srchid=SEM:700000001483645:GOOGLE:71700000083560218:58700007058367379:p63540306513:568130203136&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYxwjdPv1_7nZpBnqUuPaN_vQoW0SJKaAZh1zlsZZFCQmObr_iZT-KWBoCQVEQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds); SUVs like the [Highlander](https://www.toyota.com/highlander/); pickup trucks like [Tacoma](https://www.toyota.com/tacoma/); and, of course, hybrid and electric vehicles such as the [Prius](https://www.toyota.com/prius/?srchid=SEM:700000001483645:GOOGLE:71700000083888568:58700007090110135:p63777996263:541148610424&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjw14uVBhBEEiwAaufYx-52bqAK5Mj6wtI3F61ThU4CmDmcAqEgYDkGa3SwUbzWwbBuUSjVmhoCN8sQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
