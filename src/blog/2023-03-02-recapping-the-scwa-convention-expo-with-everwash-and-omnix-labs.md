Last week, the SCWA Convention & EXPO brought together car wash operators, suppliers, and vendors from all over the country. The show's 2591 registered attendees were treated to the latest in car wash membership and vehicle analytics from EverWash and omniX Labs.

"The show was not only well attended, but it was also very collaborative in terms of vendors and distributors just wanting to work together," said EverWash VP of Sales Mike Stern. "There's a lot of innovation out there, and a lot of growth."

In the EverWash Booth, operators were able to learn how members can improve their businesses and increase profits, while also discovering how our industry-leading member CRM and marketing plan helps them multiply those members through referrals, gift-giving, and promotions.

Meanwhile, video imaging and analytics were demonstrated on the omniX side of the booth so operators could see how video can assess different customer journey points and help improve operations and profitability.

One of the biggest hits at the SCWA was EverWash Socks! The swag sensation of the show, operators, vendors, and wash partners flocked to EverWash's booth to pick up their own pair. The socks featured EverWash's redesigned branding and logo, also revealed at the show. When you lay your eyes on the new logo's smiling car surrounded by bubbles for the first time, you will instantly feel warm and comforted. When you put the socks on, your feet will feel the same way!
