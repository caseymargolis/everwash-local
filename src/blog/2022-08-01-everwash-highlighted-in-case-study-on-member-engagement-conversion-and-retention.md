EverWash's journey to create a more valuable member onboarding experience was [recently the subject of a case study by Braze](https://www.braze.com/customers/everwash-case-study), a customer engagement platform businesses use for multichannel marketing. The case study describes how EverWash leveraged Braze and Braze Alloys solutions partner Ragnarok to strategically customize messaging and drive a 37% conversion rate on key communications.

By using multichannel marketing and [Braze's signature Canvas Flow product](https://www.everwash.com/newsroom/2022-07-18-braze-launches-next-generation-canvas-flow-tool-to-help-brands-create-dynamic-cross-channel-campaigns/), EverWash has:

* Set up push notifications, developed an [SMS strategy](https://www.braze.com/customers/pizza-hut-case-study), and created dynamic customer journeys via Braze Canvas Flow
* Employed Braze's [Intelligent Timing](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/two-ways-to-master-push-campaign-timing) send-time optimization feature to deliver messages to each user when that particular individual is most likely to engage.
* Leveraged [Liquid personalization](https://www.braze.com/resources/articles/liquid-personalization-types-101) in 91% of their campaigns, allowing further customization based on what EverWash knows about each user. 

“Canvas Flow is like a video game. All I want to do is be inside Braze all day," said Nash Goudie, EverWash's Digital Marketing & Communications Manager.

Ultimately, the Case Study offers two key takeaways:

* As a company scales, so must its marketing solutions. EverWash realized their in-house technology wasn’t going to support their growth, which led them to broaden their messaging horizons with the help of Braze tools.
* Keeping in touch from the get-go to create a user habit is critical to the success of a subscription-based service. No matter how valuable a subscription may be, customers won’t be motivated to maintain it if they don't remember to use it.
