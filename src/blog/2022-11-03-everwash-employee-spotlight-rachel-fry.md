*EverWash is made of hard-working people — just like you and the folks who work at your car wash! Here's this month's EverWash Employee Spotlight:*

## **R﻿achel Fry, HR Director**

## **Who are you, and what is your role at EverWash?**

R﻿achel Fry, HR Director

## When did you start working at EverWash, and did you have any car wash experience prior to joining?

July 2021, and nope!

## **What's your favorite thing about the car wash industry?**

How it connects people from all walks of life. Not only is car ownership a common unifying experience, but our wash partners themselves are a vibrant and multifaceted group.

## What do you like most about your job?

The people. We're all here trying to do something that's never been done before, and I really believe we have the best people for the job. And I get to support them.

## Are you a dog person or a cat person (or neither)?

I love dogs!

## Are you a morning person or a night owl?

I was a night owl but, annoyingly, am becoming a morning person with age.

## What do you do to turn things around when you’re having a bad day?

Go for a run

## What’s your guilty pleasure?

Long motorcycle trips through the mountains

## Do you have a hidden talent? What is it?

Crafting things with epoxy resin

## If you could choose a superpower, what would it be?

Telekinesis--not only can I summon objects from the fridge without moving from the couch, but I think I could also use it for flight.

## What trend do you hope makes a comeback?

Capes!

## What’s one song you have completely memorized?

Bohemian Rhapsody

## Have you ever met anyone famous? Who?

Joe Biden

## What is the best career lesson you’ve learned so far?

If you feel 100% comfortable moving into a new role, you waited too long

## What was the most unusual or interesting job you’ve ever had?

Not really a job but an unpaid "internship"--my parents own a power equipment sales and service business. So from the time I was around 11, I'd go there after school and in the summers restocking shelves and assembling the chainsaws, string trimmers, and other equipment.

## Favorite travel spot/recommendation?

The British Isles

## Where would you like to go on a dream vacation?

New Zealand
