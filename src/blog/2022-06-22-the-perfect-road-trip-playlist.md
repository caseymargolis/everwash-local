Aside from friends and family, the perfect road trip companion is music!

We surveyed EverWash employees to bring you **The Perfect Road Trip Playlist** (According to EverWash)!

**“Panama” by Van Halen:** The perfect kick-off song once you’ve hit the open road. It exists to be loudly blasted through a car speaker (preferably with the top down).
