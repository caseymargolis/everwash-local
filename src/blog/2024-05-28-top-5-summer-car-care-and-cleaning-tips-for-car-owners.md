Summer is just around the corner, and it's the perfect time to get your car in tip-top shape for all those upcoming road trips and sunny adventures. Here are five summer car care and cleaning tips from EverWash to quickly, easily, and affordably spruce up your car before the heat truly kicks in.

### Declutter Your Car Before and After a Road Trip

There's nothing worse than starting a summer road trip with a messy, cluttered car. Not only does it make your journey less enjoyable, but it can also be a safety hazard. Before you hit the road, take some time to declutter your car. Remove unnecessary items from the trunk, backseat, and glove compartment. This will give you more space for essentials like luggage, snacks, and emergency kits.

After your trip, it's equally important to declutter again. Dispose of any trash, remove leftover food containers, and store away items you won't need for your daily commute. This routine not only keeps your car clean but also helps you maintain a sense of order and readiness for your next adventure.

### Check and Replace Your Wipers

Summer showers can come unexpectedly, and having a clear windshield is crucial for safe driving. Over time, wiper blades can wear out and become less effective, leaving streaks or even scratching your windshield. Before summer fully arrives, check your wipers for any signs of wear and tear, such as cracks or splits.

If your wipers are looking worse for wear, replace them with a new set. It's a simple and inexpensive fix that can make a significant difference in your visibility during rainy summer days. For an extra touch, consider applying a rain-repellent treatment to your windshield to improve water runoff and visibility.

### Protect Your Car's Exterior with Wax

Summer sun can be harsh on your car's paint, causing it to fade and lose its shine. Protect your car's exterior by applying wax or ceramic coating. Waxing and ceramics not only enhance the look of your car but also create a protective barrier against UV rays, road grime, and other environmental contaminants.

Before applying any coating, make sure your car is thoroughly washed and dried. Apply in small, circular motions using a clean applicator pad, and then buff it off with a microfiber towel for a brilliant, long-lasting shine. Regular treatments will keep your car looking its best and preserve its value.

### Deep Clean Your Car's Interior

A thorough interior cleaning can make your car feel brand new. Start by vacuuming the seats, floor mats, and carpets to remove dust, dirt, and crumbs. Pay special attention to areas that are often overlooked, like under the seats and in the crevices between seat cushions.

Next, wipe down all surfaces with a suitable cleaner. Use a microfiber cloth for the dashboard, center console, and door panels to avoid scratches. Don't forget to clean the windows inside and out for a crystal-clear view. For a finishing touch, add a fresh scent with an air freshener or a few drops of essential oil on a cotton ball placed under the seats.

### Enroll in an EverWash Membership
