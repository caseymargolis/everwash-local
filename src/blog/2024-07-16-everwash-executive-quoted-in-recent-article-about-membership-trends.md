Car wash memberships have proven to be resilient amidst economic challenges, as highlighted in a recent article by Rich DiPaolo in Professional Carwashing & Detailing magazine. The article, titled [“How is the membership trend holding up?”](https://www.carwash.com/carwash-membership-performance/), features insights from industry leaders, including [Chris Villella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-villella-9553275/), EverWash’s Vice President of Business Development.

### **Steady Performance of Memberships**

Chris Villella shared encouraging news about the performance of car wash memberships, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. Villella noted, “Since 2022, even with the continued economic uncertainty, LTV \[lifetime value] continues to exceed forecasts and perform extremely well from both a financial and length of membership perspective.” 

### **Importance of Customer Feedback**

Villella also emphasized the critical role of customer feedback in refining membership programs. He stated, “A key strategy is collecting comprehensive feedback from members through surveys, reviews, and even when they are on property. Identifying potential pain points can provide the operator with the feedback and insights into areas for improvement and potential opportunities.” By actively seeking and analyzing customer input, car wash operators can make informed decisions to enhance their services and retain members.

### **Enhancing Membership Value**

The article discusses several strategies for improving car wash membership programs, such as sending reminder emails to new members, forming partnerships with local retailers for added benefits, and maintaining high-quality customer service. Villella’s insights align with these strategies, underscoring the importance of continuous improvement based on customer feedback.
