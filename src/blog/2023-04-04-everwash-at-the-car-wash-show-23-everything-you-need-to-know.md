May is not only pollen season for the car wash industry, but also the season of The Car Wash Show! Over 8000 attendees are expected to attend the ICA-produced show at the Las Vegas Convention Center from May 8th through May 10th, as well as 375 exhibitors and more than 60 hours of educational programming.

EverWash will be exhibiting in **Booth #1419 & Booth # 338**. Our primary booth is located near the entrance to Hall W2, between Micrologic and Sonny's.

During the Car Wash Show, we will highlight three key products: EverWash Membership and EverWash Analytics, powered by omniX Labs.

**EverWash Membership** is our foundational product, where car wash operators partner with EverWash to manage their unlimited programs. Membership experts provide setup assistance, sales training, customer service, and marketing resources to wash partners to help develop, nurture, and optimize a strong source of recurring monthly revenue through membership. [Learn more about EverWash Membership here](https://www.everwash.com/wash-owners/membership).

**EverWash Analytics**, powered by omniX Labs, is our car wash analytics service. EverWash acquired Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence firm omniX Labs in 2021. Using onmiX's patented technology, we can turn existing cameras into trusted eyes and smart business advisers. We're dubbing omniX for car washes as EverWash Analytics. [Learn more about EverWash Analytics here](https://www.everwash.com/wash-owners/analytics).

EverWash Analytics securely connects to cameras, analyzes live video streams, and returns synthesized analytics and insights on a dashboard. Sales, Member, and Labor Insights are available to operators to help them make more informed business decisions.

Lastly, **EverWas Assist** is a new call center service, consisting of live, on-the-phone voice agents who answer support calls for car wash operators, provide resolution-based customer support, and kick-start failed payment recovery. We'll have more to share about this exciting new product in **Innovation Alley Booth #338**.

Each product can be used independently of the other, so wash operators running their own successful membership programs can add **EverWash Analytics** or **EverWash Assist** to their operation without a hitch. Stop by our main booth or the EverWash Assist area in Innovation Alley, and speak to one of our representatives to learn more about each product and how they can fit into your wash.

Staff from EverWash and omniX will also present and moderate panel discussions at The Car Wash Show.

omniX Labs Founder & CEO Anoop Kanthan will participate in a panel discussion on Artificial and Predictive Intelligence and its impact on car washes on **Monday, May 8th at 3:30 PM**.

Harriet Ayoade, VP of Marketing at EverWash, and Max Pulcini, Director of Marketing & Communications, will host a 30-minute breakout branding session on **Tuesday, May 9th at 9:30 AM**. The session will feature one of our first wash partners, Craig Gilham from Sudz Car Wash in Gonzalez, Texas, to educate attendees on the importance of brand synergy, as well as how to leverage technology and data as a wash operator.

Harriet will participate in another panel later on **Tuesday, May 9th at 3:30 PM**, covering the topic of Sports Sponsorship and how car washes can leverage local sports celebrity relationships. She'll bring in our real-world experience as sponsors of the Philadelphia Union MLS team to help paint the discussion.

We look forward to speaking with you at the Car Wash Show â€” either at our booth or following any of our various speaking events.
