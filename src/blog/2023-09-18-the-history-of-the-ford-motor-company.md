Whether you drive a sporty Mustang, a robust F-150, or any other car, we believe in keeping your ride looking its best. But today, we’re going to take a different route and delve into the rich history of the Ford Motor Company — a story of innovation, fierce competition, and an unwavering commitment to quality. 

From the Model T to the current technological advances, Ford has become an American icon. Let's journey together through this tale that has many EverWash members saying, "I drive a Ford, and I am proud of it."

## The Model T: A Car for Everyone

The story of Ford cannot be told without mentioning the car that started it all — the Model T. Henry Ford famously said, "Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black." 

Launched in 1908, the Model T revolutionized transportation and American industry. By implementing the first moving assembly line in 1913, Ford made cars affordable, thereby changing the very fabric of American life. At EverWash, we marvel at this initial push towards mass production, which made cars — and, by extension, car washes — accessible to all.

## Consumer Favorites: Mustang, Focus, and F-150

Ford has always had a knack for creating consumer favorites. The Mustang, released in 1964, became a sensation overnight, epitomizing the American muscle car. The F-150 has been America's best-selling vehicle for over four decades, known for its durability and adaptability. In the compact segment, the Focus, introduced in 1998, has gained worldwide acclaim for its efficiency and performance.

## Ford vs Ferrari: The Battle at Le Mans

Sporting accomplishments? Let's talk about one of the most legendary duels in racing history — Ford vs Ferrari at the 1966 Le Mans. After a failed acquisition of Ferrari, Henry Ford II decided to do the unthinkable: Beat Ferrari at their own game. 

Carroll Shelby, played by Matt Damon in the popular movie "Ford vs Ferrari," took on the challenge to build a car that would dethrone Ferrari. The result was the Ford GT40. In a race that has become a stuff of legends, Ford clinched the first, second, and third positions, leaving Ferrari in the dust.

## Back with a Vengeance: The Bronco

After a 25-year hiatus, Ford relaunched the Bronco in 2020. A nod to its rugged past, the new Bronco is designed to tackle any terrain, a testament to Ford's commitment to innovation and consumer needs. Much like how EverWash has expanded its capabilities to offer end-to-end solutions for a carefree car wash experience, Ford has evolved to meet the changing tastes and needs of its loyal customer base.

## Moving Toward a Sustainable Future

As we look towards the future, it's essential to note what Ford's R&D department is cooking up. With electric and autonomous vehicles gaining traction, Ford has rolled out models like the Mustang Mach-E and the all-electric F-150 Lightning. The company is investing billions into EV infrastructure and development.

From the Model T to the F-150 and everything in between, Ford's history is a testament to the American spirit of ingenuity and enterprise. Whether you’re a Ford aficionado or just someone who loves their car, EverWash is here to make your car wash experience seamless. With month-to-month memberships you can cancel anytime, and an array of plans to suit every vehicle, we make car washing as enjoyable and carefree as a Sunday drive in a Ford Mustang.
