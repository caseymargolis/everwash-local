The car wash industry has been abuzz with discussions surrounding the [pending legislation proposing changes to the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Negative Option Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/03/negative-reinforcement-ftc-proposes-amending-negative-option-rule-include-click-cancel-other?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=255605305&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--PssD2g5Iy9V4OHdvgm7ugAlG-4wqsdZ5z7wH5YoLgtZ_xO3x9FKVcJbF2CvlocOG8MDAEg7tKzA_4bRaJRYLwu46JAw&utm_content=255605305&utm_source=hs_email). These proposed amendments could change subscription services and memberships by making it easier for consumers to cancel recurring charges.

As a car wash operator, it is crucial to understand these proposed changes and their potential implications for your business, conversions, membership program, and bottom line. That's why EverWash is putting together a series of blog posts to help you understand the proposed regulations, negative option features, and the pros and cons of the legislation if it were to pass. This is Part One of that series.

In this article, we will summarize potential new requirements and proposed changes, exploring the reasons behind the new rules.

### What is the FTC's Negative Option Rule?

The FTC's Negative Option Rule is a regulation that governs certain business practices related to negative option offers. A negative option offer or negative option marketing constitutes a sales promotional technique where a consumer's silence or failure to take action is considered as a material fact or acceptance of an offer (automatic renewal), leading to recurring charges or ongoing obligations.

The Negative Option Rule was established to protect consumers from deceptive practices and misrepresentations to ensure they have adequate information and control when entering into recurring billing arrangements. It requires businesses to disclose all material terms of the offer clearly and conspicuously before obtaining the consumer's billing information. This includes details about recurring charges, annual reminders, cancellation procedures, and other important aspects of the transaction to avoid deceptive practices.

Overall, the FTC's Negative Option Rule serves to promote transparency, consumer protection, and fair business practices in the context of recurring billing arrangements. The proposed changes to the rules aim to further strengthen these principles and address common consumer complaints and concerns like simple cancellation.

### What Are the Proposed Changes to the FTC's Negative Option Rule?

Several proposed rules and amendments are being discussed to change the Negative Option Rule to modernize it to fit the current subscription economy landscape: Clear disclosure of deal details, affirmative consent, and click-to-cancel standards.

#### **Clear Disclosure of Deal Details**

One of the proposed amendments requires companies to provide comprehensive information before obtaining consumers' billing details. These changes in negative option plans include explicitly stating that payments will be recurring, specifying the deadline for stopping charges, disclosing the total cost, providing the date of the payment submission, and offering information on cancellation procedures to avoid automatic renewals. These requirements aim to address consumer complaints regarding insufficient information about negative option offers.

#### **Express Informed Consent**

In order to protect consumers from unauthorized charges, the proposed amendment aligns with the [Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA)](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/restore-online-shoppers-confidence-act) by emphasizing the need for companies to obtain consumers' express informed consent for auto-renewals. This provision offers additional guidance to businesses on how to comply with the rule and aims to curb illegal practices related to unwanted billing, enrollment, or delivery of physical goods without consent.

#### **Implementation of Click-to-Cancel**

In response to consumer frustrations with canceling subscriptions online and through the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the proposed amendment suggests implementing click-to-cancel functionality. This requirement seeks to eliminate obstacles and facilitate the simple cancellation process for consumers. Businesses would be mandated to grant a cancellation mechanism the same way customers enroll, providing a frictionless experience.

### Reasons Behind the Proposed Changes

The FTC's proposed changes to the Negative Option Rule stem from a growing concern for consumer rights and the need to prevent deceptive practices within the subscription-based business model. Several factors have contributed to these proposed amendments:

* **Consumer Protection:** The aim is to provide consumers with more transparency and control over their subscriptions, reducing instances of unauthorized charges and ensuring they have clear information before entering into recurring payment agreements. These changes align with broader efforts to protect consumers' rights and promote fair business practices.
* **Addressing Consumer Complaints:** The FTC has received numerous public comments and complaints regarding negative option offers, such as insufficient information about recurring charges, continuity plans, difficulties in canceling subscriptions, lack of prenotification plans, and unauthorized billing. The proposed amendments seek to address these common grievances and enhance consumer satisfaction.
* **Aligning with Existing Regulations:** The proposed amendments to the Negative Option Rule are in line with existing gov state laws and legislation like ROSCA, which focuses on protecting consumers in online transactions. Harmonizing the new rules with existing negative option rules help create a clear regulatory framework that safeguards consumers' interests and encourages responsible business practices.
