EverWash, the nation’s leading car wash membership platform, is excited to announce the acquisition of JetSpring's car wash customer service division. JetSpring is a full-service contact center that offers a broad range of digital communication and customer support solutions for the car wash and higher education sectors. The deal is expected to close by early Q3, 2023.

EverWash's acquisition of JetSpring's car wash support service means that their team of live call center agents and their brand-specific chatbots are being repackaged and offered to the car wash industry as EverWash Assist: a new 24/7 service that supports the needs of all car wash operators at affordable prices.

"We've always valued the impact of strong customer support at EverWash, with our Call Center always being a core service we've offered," said Scott Caplan, CEO and Founder of EverWash. "With our acquisition of JetSpring's car wash support resources, we are able to expand our industry-leading member support service to more washes, regardless of whether you are a current EverWash Membership wash partner or not."

EverWash Assist will feature teams of live voice agents who answer support calls for car washes. Agents will engage callers and provide resolution-backed customer support, and kick-start failed payment recovery, turning support calls into a valuable customer experience that translates into increased loyalty and retention. 

This level of high-quality support has been shown to drop membership cancellation rates by up to 46% within the first 90 days of enrollment and by as much as 62% within the first 18 months with JetSpring's current customer base of car washes. Live agents will also provide white-glove customer service to any car wash operator who has a question or need with their current EverWash services.

JetSprings's chatbots will also be available via EverWash Assist for operators who want to take a more modern approach to customer engagement. AI-powered chatbots can expand retention and support initiatives while managing resources, giving consumers easy access to all the information they’ll need along their journey. Each JetSpring chatbot is custom-designed with a wash's needs and goals in mind. 

The EverWash Assist team will be there every step of the way to ensure that call center agents and chatbots deliver results and work efficiently and effectively in the context of any car wash organization.

"We're excited to join forces with a brand as respected as EverWash," said Eric Kades, CEO and Founder of JetSpring. "Through EverWash Assist, we look forward to leveraging our car wash support resources, call centers, and cutting-edge chatbot technology to set a new standard for customer support in the car wash industry. We're also excited to make it available to all car wash operators immediately."

EverWash Assist is an independent service, so being an EverWash Membership wash partner is not a requirement. Car wash operators can contact an EverWash representative to learn more about EverWash Assist. Visit [EverWash.com](http://www.everwash.com/) to get started.
