‘‘Wash Together, Win Together”’ is the EverWash membership promise to car wash owners and their customers alike. It’s the foundation of membership success for washes across the country. We also recognize the tremendous value wash distributors bring to wash success.

Our new “Wash Together, Win Together Distributor Program” further strengthens our wash membership success formula by bringing another valuable resource to bear in growing wash membership and wash profits. 

Wash owners will benefit from the new “Wash Together, Win Together Distributor Program,” which provides incentives to distributors for investing in a wash’s membership program marketing efforts.

Notes Chief Revenue Officer Scott Pashley, “The equipment, chemical, and service providers who support wash owners bring tremendous expertise, operational know-how, and resources that can help washes accelerate membership growth, achieve best-in-class operations, and generate more profits.”

He added: “We believe by working more closely with these valued contributors to support our wash partner owners, we create a ‘win-win-win’ for everyone.”
