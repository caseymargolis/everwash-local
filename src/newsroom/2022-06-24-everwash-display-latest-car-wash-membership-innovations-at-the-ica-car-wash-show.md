ICA’s Car Wash Show 2021, held in Las Vegas from November 15th to 17th turned out a huge crowd of car wash owners, operators, investors, and exhibitors after the 2020 show cancellation, and the EverWash booth was the center of attention from start to finish!

The EverWash team had a unique opportunity to engage with prospective wash customers and customers alike, demonstrating the many ways EverWash technology and products can drive more business to a wash and convert more customers into loyal members.

Featured in the EverWash booth was the EverWash mobile app, the company’s Total Membership Lifecycle approach to successful membership, its full array of “smart marketing” solutions, its wash owner membership performance data, its new EverWash Direct program for washes with existing membership programs/. EverWash even showed off its forthcoming ‘Virtual Attendant’ technology, which drew a continuous stream of amazed visitors. 

Adjacent to the EverWash booth was the omniX exhibit, which also drew a crowd.  Formerly known as WashX, the omniX analytics solution captures actionable marketing data from each vehicle.  Car wash operators gain heretofore unavailable customer behavioral intelligence that can help them win more repeat business, target new customer segments, and grow membership.
