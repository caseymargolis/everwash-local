Zep Vehicle Care Inc. has named EverWash Inc. as its preferred unlimited wash club partner. Under this new partnership, and starting in the Northeast, Zep will promote and provide the EverWash membership sales, marketing and subscription management platform to its carwash customers with the aim of helping them increase wash volume and revenue, the release continued.

“We found that customers with successful membership programs were washing more cars, using more chemicals and increasing their profits,” said Greg Heyer, chief commercial officer for Zep Vehicle Care. “EverWash has positioned themselves as the leader in the carwash industry when it comes to selling, managing and marketing membership while driving monthly recurring revenue to their wash partners. It was an easy decision to choose them as a strategic partner for helping our customers drive membership.”

“Just like how Zep’s industry-leading chemistry and soaps help wash operators produce the cleanest vehicles possible, our membership sales and subscription management platform provides the surest, quickest route to more members, more profit and the most comprehensive membership solution in the industry,” said John Cassady, EverWash CEO. “We’re excited for the opportunity to team up with such a well-established partner in Zep Vehicle Care to help more carwashes grow their monthly recurring revenue stream like never before.”
