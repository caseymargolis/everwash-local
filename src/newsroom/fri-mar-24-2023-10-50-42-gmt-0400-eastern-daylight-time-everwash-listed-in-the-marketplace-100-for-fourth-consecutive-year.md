**March 24, 2023 \[PHILADELPHIA]** — EverWash, the nation’s leading car wash membership platform, today announced they have ranked #64 on the a16z Marketplace 100, a ranking of the largest consumer-facing marketplace startups and private companies. 

"It is an honor to once again be recognized by Andreessen-Horowitz," said Scott Caplan, CEO and Co-Founder of EverWash. “Being consistently listed among the top marketplaces in the country, especially in this current economic climate, is a major accomplishment for our team. This year, we will continue to provide value to our wash partners and drive more Americans to local car washes at an affordable cost."

EverWash provides customers with unlimited car washes at in-network car wash providers at an affordable monthly fee and allows them to check in directly from the app. The technology company offers car wash partners a tech-enabled membership platform, staff training, customer service, and marketing support. More recently, EverWash acquired omniX Labs to offer car washes advanced vehicle, sales, and operations analytics.

This is the fourth year in a row that EverWash has been ranked on the annual list by Andreessen-Horowitz, a Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm. The rankings are based on a blend of data from Bloomberg Second Measure, Similarweb, and Apptopia. The full list can be viewed here.
