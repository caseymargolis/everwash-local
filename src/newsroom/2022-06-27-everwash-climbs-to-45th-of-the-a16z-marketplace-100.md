EverWash is pleased to report that our company was recently ranked on the Andreessen Horowitz a16z Marketplace 100 for the second year in a row, climbing from the 66th position to 45th among the 100 companies listed in the overall index.

The rankings are published by Andreessen Horowitz, a Menlo Park, California based venture capital firm, based on data from Second Measure, a firm that analyzes billions of purchases to track consumer behavior and relative sales across 5,200 merchants. 

Noted CEO John Cassady, “Despite the overwhelming uncertainty the pandemic caused, our team was able to position us as thought leaders in our industry and continued to grow the EverWash network to new heights in 2020. 

“EverWash is firmly established as the country’s largest car wash network, and continues to help the car wash industry break membership goals in 2021. As the world turns the corner and re-enters ‘normalcy’, we look forward to continuing down this path and providing clean cars to even more Americans.”

According to Andresson-Horowitz, the startups and private companies on the Marketplace 100 are then ranked using a common industry metric, Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), which is extrapolated from the total dollars consumers are spending against each company.  

Last year, [a16z described EverWash as](https://a16z.com/2020/02/18/marketplace-100/) “the most surprising company of the top five fastest-growers: “These up-and-coming companies offer the best indication of future marketplace categories. Interestingly, these companies are emblematic of emerging categories among millennial and Gen Z consumers.”

Despite challenges with COVID-19, including the temporary closure of car washes across the country, our company maintained its growth and, like many of the other marketplaces listed in the a16z Index, proved to be extraordinarily resilient. It’s also worth mentioning that the difference in GMV among companies ranked #4-100 is less than a half a percentage point, which places EverWash in the same discussion as brands like StockX, Spot Hero, MasterClass, and Offer UP.
