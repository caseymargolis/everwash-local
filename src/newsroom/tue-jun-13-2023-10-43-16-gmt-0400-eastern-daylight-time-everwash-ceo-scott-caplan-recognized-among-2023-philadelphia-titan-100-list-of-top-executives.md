Titan CEO and headline sponsor Wipfli LLP are pleased to announce Scott Caplan, CEO and Founder of EverWash, as a 2023 Philadelphia Titan 100. The Titan 100 program recognizes Philadelphia’s Top 100 CEO’s & C-level executives. They are the area’s most accomplished business leaders in their industry using criteria that includes demonstrating exceptional leadership, vision, and passion. Collectively the 2023 Philadelphia Titan 100 and their companies employ upwards of 93,000 individuals and generate over $33 billion dollars in annual revenues.

“The Titan 100 are shaping the future of the Philadelphia business community by building a distinguished reputation that is unrivaled and preeminent in their field," says Jaime Zawmon, President of Titan CEO. "We proudly recognize the Titan 100 for their successes and contributions. We know that they will have a profound impact that makes an extraordinary difference for their customers and clients across the nation.” 

A native of the Philadelphia area and serial entrepreneur, Scott initially made a name for himself in the business community with Sweat Fitness, a chain of fitness clubs. He founded EverWash in 2016 based on the idea that other industries could benefit from the gym membership model and the power of a strong network. He currently lives in the Philly suburbs with his wife, two children, and toy poodle.

"I am deeply honored and humbled to accept this prestigious recognition as a member of the Philadelphia Titan 100 list. To be counted among the city's most influential and accomplished leaders is truly a privilege. Being included in this esteemed list further motivates me to continue striving for excellence in my field and making a positive impact on the Philadelphia community. I am proud to be part of a vibrant city that values innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship."

Scott will be honored at the annual Titan 100 awards celebration on September 21st, 2023, at “The Drexelbrook” located in Drexel Hill, PA.  From hosting American Bandstand with Dick Clark to surviving a 1978 fire, the Drexelbrook has changed and evolved for more than 70 years to best suit the community as a private club, hotel, and event center.  

“On behalf of the partners and associates at Wipfli we congratulate all the Titan100 winners. It’s an honor to recognize this diverse group of leaders in the Philadelphia community," says W. Bradley Baturka, Mid Atlantic Leader and Partner at Wipfli. "We appreciate the lasting impact each leader has made, and continues to make, in building organizations of significance that in many cases have not only local but national and international reach. Your ingenuity and creativity have set you apart, and the honor of being seen as an industry Titan is richly deserved.”
