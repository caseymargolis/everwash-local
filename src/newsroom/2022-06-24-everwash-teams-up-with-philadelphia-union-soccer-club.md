The Philadelphia Union and EverWash announced they have entered into a partnership to make EverWash the Official Car Wash Membership Partner of the Philadelphia Union and Subaru Park.

“EverWash is beyond excited to partner with our neighbors at the Philadelphia Union,” said Scott Pashley, Chief Revenue Officer of EverWash. “The Union is setting the pace in the MLS Eastern Conference just as we’re setting the pace for membership programs in the car wash industry.

“We’re looking forward to connecting Unions fans with our community of locally-owned car washes so they can save money and simplify essential vehicle maintenance.,” he added.

EverWash will have an engaging presence at Subaru Park on game days, including advertising and activations such as in-stadium branding and content, digital signage visible on television broadcasts, fan engagement activities within Subaru Plaza, and more.

The Philadelphia-based tech company will also be the presenting sponsor for each “clean sheet”, or shut-out, that the Union earns during the team’s season, which kicks off February 26 at 1 p.m. ET.
